    <h2>The Tragedy of Tasawwuf through Shafak and Barks</h2>

    <p>
      In a world where Tasawwuf—the sacred inward journey of Sufism—is deeply rooted in devotion, discipline, and spiritual annihilation, the modern popular interpretations by writers like Elif Shafak and Coleman Barks pose a tragic dilution of its essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their writings, often appealing and poetic, strip away the rigorous discipline and spiritual transmission (silsilah) from master to student that lies at the heart of Tasawwuf. This blog reflects on how such translations and reinterpretations may resonate with the heart but often miss the spirit, essence, and purpose of the Sufi path.

    <p>
      True Tasawwuf is not a dance of metaphors but a silent struggle of the self, a path where one annihilates ego through muraqabah, dhikr, and the guidance of a living Shaykh.
